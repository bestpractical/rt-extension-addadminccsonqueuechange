NAME
    RT-Extension-AddAdminCcsOnQueueChange - Keep AdminCcs in the loop

DESCRIPTION
    This extension adds a new action, Add Queue AdminCcs to Ticket, as well
    as a global scrip using it, which copies over Queue AdminCcs to the
    ticket when it is moved between queues. This ensures that the previous
    queue's AdminCcs are still notified of changes to the ticket, and
    potentially granted rights as well.

    Install this extension if you have multiple queues with differing sets
    of AdminCcs, move tickets between queues often, and want the old queue's
    AdminCcs to be kept updated after it is moved.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0 and 4.2.
