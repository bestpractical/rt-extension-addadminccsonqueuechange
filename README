This RT extension adds an "Add Queue AdminCcs as Ticket AdminCcs" action, which
is installed by default as a global queue action set to trigger when a ticket
is moved to a new queue.  It adds the *old* queue's AdminCcs to the ticket
(the thought being that AdminCcs on the old queue will want to be kept "in the
loop" on action occuring in the new queue, even if they aren't directly in
control of it).  

Note that as currently implemented the action only works on queue change 
transactions.  Also, if the scrip is added to a single queue individually 
instead of all queues globally, it will only run when tickets are moved *into* 
the queue (although it will correctly add the old queue's AdminCcs to the 
ticket).  

To install:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install
    make initdb
